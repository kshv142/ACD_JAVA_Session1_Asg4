Problem: Write a program in java to implement type casting between different variables.

a) Take six variables as one of each byte, short, int, long, float and double. Initialize only byte
and short asking the value from the user.

b) Take byte & short variables and store their sum in the integer variable and print the sum
and then take short and int and store their addition in a long variable and now take an int
and long and so on.
